# Interactive-Radar-System-with-Servo-Motor-Control
This is an interactive radar system implemented using the Processing programming language and Arduino Uno. The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement and a servo motor for controlling the sensor's angle. It provides a graphical representation of the detected distance and angle, creating a radar-like display on the screen.
