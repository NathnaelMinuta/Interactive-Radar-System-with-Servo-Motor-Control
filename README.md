# Interactive-Radar-System-with-Servo-Motor-Control
This is an interactive radar system implemented using the Processing programming language and Arduino Uno. The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement and a servo motor for controlling the sensor's angle. It provides a graphical representation of the detected distance and angle, creating a radar-like display on the screen.

Key Features:

1. Real-time visualization: The system reads data from the ultrasonic sensor via Arduino Uno and displays the detected objects on the screen in real-time.

2. Interactive display: The radar display shows the angle and distance of detected objects, with the angle controlled by the servo motor.
Adjustable range: Users can customize the maximum range for detecting objects by modifying the Arduino code.

3. Object status indication: The system indicates whether an object is within range or out of range based on the set maximum range.

4. User-friendly interface: The graphical user interface provides clear visual feedback and displays the angle, distance, and object status in a readable format.

5. Easy customization: The code can be easily modified to adapt to different sensor configurations or incorporate additional functionalities.

Hardware Components:

1. Arduino Uno: The Arduino board controls the servo motor and handles the communication between the ultrasonic sensor and the Processing program.

2. Ultrasonic sensor: The sensor is used for distance measurement and object detection.

3. Servo motor: The servo motor controls the angle of the ultrasonic sensor, allowing it to sweep across the range.
